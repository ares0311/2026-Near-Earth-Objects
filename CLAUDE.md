# CLAUDE.md — NEO Detection & Ranking Project

This file is read automatically by Claude Code at session start.
It contains the facts a coding agent needs to work productively without re-reading every document.

---

## Standing Rules

- **Skills directory**: Any standalone `.py` utility script created to perform a task must be saved in `Skills/` at the project root.
- **No impact claims**: Never assert a probability of Earth impact from internally computed data alone. Always defer to MPC/CNEOS for authoritative hazard assessment.
- **Alert protocol is sacred**: The NASA/MPC alert pathway (see §Alert Protocol) must never be triggered on unconfirmed detections. Require independent confirmation first.

## Project

**Near-Earth Object Detection and Ranking Pipeline**
Automated pipeline for detecting, linking, classifying, and ranking Near-Earth Object (NEO) candidates from publicly available survey photometry, with MPC-compatible reporting and a NASA alert pathway for high-confidence hazard signals.

Repository: `<owner>/neo-detection` (to be created)
Active branch: `main`

## Scientific Context

Near-Earth Objects are small solar system bodies with perihelion distances $q < 1.3$ AU. They are divided into four dynamical classes:

| Class | Definition |
|---|---|
| Amor | $1.017 < q < 1.3$ AU |
| Apollo | $a > 1.0$ AU, $q < 1.017$ AU |
| Aten | $a < 1.0$ AU, $Q > 0.983$ AU |
| IEO (Atira) | $Q < 0.983$ AU |

Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) are NEOs with absolute magnitude $H \leq 22$ (diameter $\gtrsim 140$ m) and Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID) $\leq 0.05$ AU. The pipeline must identify and flag PHA candidates.

The global NEO survey is dominated by:
- **ZTF** (Zwicky Transient Facility) — primary data source; public alert stream
- **ATLAS** — Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System; 24–48 hr warning capability
- **Pan-STARRS** — deep survey; public catalog access
- **CSS** (Catalina Sky Survey) — MPC-feeding survey

As of 2026, approximately 35,000 NEOs are known. Rubin/LSST is expected to discover 100,000+ more over its 10-year survey.

## Architecture

```
Fetch → Preprocess → Detect → Link → Classify → Score → Alert
```

Each stage produces a typed, immutable result object. No shared mutable state.

### Module Build Order

## Data Sources

### Primary Survey Data

**ZTF (recommended primary source)**
- Public alert stream via IRSA (`ztfquery` Python package or direct API)
- 3-night cadence over the full northern sky; $g$, $r$, $i$ bands
- Difference-image alerts include cutouts (science, reference, difference) — ideal for CNN input
- Access: `pip install ztfquery`; IRSA account required (free)
- Key fields per alert: `ra`, `dec`, `jd`, `magpsf`, `sigmapsf`, `fid`, `rb` (real/bogus score), `drb` (deep learning real/bogus), `ssdistnr`, `ssmagnr`

**ATLAS Forced Photometry Server**
- Public REST API; forced photometry at any sky position
- Orange ($o$) and cyan ($c$) bands; 2-day cadence
- Useful for confirming candidates found in ZTF
- Access: `https://fallingstar-data.com/forcedphot/`

**Minor Planet Center (MPC)**
- Known object catalog: `astroquery.mpc` or direct MPC API
- NEO Confirmation Page (NEOCP): unconfirmed candidates needing follow-up
- Submit formatted reports for new detections
- Access: `from astroquery.mpc import MPC`

**JPL Horizons / CNEOS**
- Ephemerides for known objects: `astroquery.jplhorizons`
- Close approach tables: CNEOS API
- Scout and Sentry impact monitoring output (read-only reference)

### Astrometric Reference
- **Gaia DR3** via `astroquery.gaia` — sub-milliarcsecond astrometry for calibration

---

## Core Design Decisions

### DECISION-001: ZTF as Primary Survey
ZTF provides the richest freely available alert stream with pre-computed difference images, a native real/bogus score, and a well-documented Python API. It is the most scientifically productive single choice for a new project without telescope access.

### DECISION-002: Tiered ML Architecture
Follow the same three-tier approach as the exoplanet pipeline:
- **Tier 1**: Gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost/LightGBM) on tabular features — fast, interpretable, works with small labeled sets (~500 examples)
- **Tier 2**: CNN on ZTF image triplets (science / reference / difference cutouts) — proven for real/bogus classification (Duev et al. 2019)
- **Tier 3**: Transformer on tracklet sequences — frontier method for multi-night linking and NEO type classification (Lin et al. 2022)

### DECISION-003: No Autonomous Impact Claims
The pipeline produces a ranked candidate list and hazard flags. It never autonomously asserts a probability of Earth impact. The alert pathway requires a computed MOID ≤ 0.05 AU AND independent MPC confirmation before any NASA notification.

### DECISION-004: MPC-Compatible Output First
All detections must be expressible in MPC 80-column format or the newer MPC JSON format. This ensures interoperability with the global NEO community regardless of downstream ML additions.

### DECISION-005: Conservative Classification
Mirror the exoplanet pipeline's conservatism:
- `None` feature scores fail gate conditions
- Unknown objects default to "candidate" not "confirmed NEO"
- PHAs require orbit quality code ≥ 2 before flagging

## Pipeline Stage Specifications

### 1. fetch.py
**Inputs**: sky region (RA, Dec, radius) or target list, date range, survey selection
**Process**:
- Query ZTF alert stream via IRSA or `ztfquery`
- Download ATLAS forced photometry for confirmed positions
- Query MPC for known objects in the search field
- Query JPL Horizons for ephemerides of known NEOs

**Output**: `FetchResult(alerts, provenance: FetchProvenance)`

**Notes**:
- Lazy-import all survey-specific libraries inside functions
- Cache raw alerts to disk; never re-download what is already cached
- Record survey, filter, limiting magnitude, and epoch in provenance

### 2. preprocess.py
**Inputs**: raw alerts with image cutouts
**Process**:
- Validate difference image quality (PSF, background RMS)
- Normalize cutout pixel values to [0,1] for CNN input
- Extract aperture photometry and morphological features
- Apply astrometric correction relative to Gaia DR3

**Output**: `PreprocessResult(sources, provenance: PreprocessProvenance)`

**Notes**:
- No external image-subtraction pipeline needed — ZTF alerts already include difference cutouts
- For ATLAS: use forced-photometry magnitudes directly

### 3. detect.py
**Inputs**: preprocessed source catalog
**Process**:
- Filter on real/bogus score (`rb ≥ 0.65` default threshold; configurable)
- Identify moving sources: compare positions across epochs; compute apparent motion rate
- Flag streaks/trails (fast-moving NEOs may trail in 30s ZTF exposures)
- Cross-match against MPC known object ephemerides to separate new vs. known

**Output**: `DetectResult(candidates: list[RawCandidate], known_matches: list[KnownMatch])`

### 4. link.py
**Inputs**: single-night candidates across multiple nights
**Process**:
- Implement a simplified tracklet linker (THOR-inspired; Moeyens et al. 2021):
  - Pair detections consistent with solar system object motion (0.01–60 arcsec/hr)
  - Extend pairs to triplets and longer arcs using a $\chi^2$ orbit-consistency test
- Require ≥3 detections on ≥2 nights for a reportable tracklet
- Compute arc length, motion rate, position angle, and rate uncertainty

**Output**: `LinkResult(tracklets: list[Tracklet])`

**Notes**:
- Pure numpy/scipy implementation; no external orbit-determination dependency at this stage
- `orbit.py` handles full orbit fitting downstream

### 5. classify.py
**Inputs**: linked tracklets + image cutouts
**Process** (three-tier, build in order):

**Tier 1 — XGBoost on tabular features**
- Features: real/bogus score, motion rate, arc length, nights observed, brightness, color index, streak score, PSF elongation, MPC match distance
- Labels: ZTF real/bogus labels + MPC confirmed NEO catalog
- Output: `real_bogus_score`, `neo_class_confidence` as `OptScore`

**Tier 2 — CNN on image triplets** (build after Tier 1 is calibrated)
- Input: 63×63 pixel cutout triplets (science, reference, difference) normalized to [0,1]
- Architecture: adapted from Duev et al. (2019) — three parallel convolutional branches merged at dense layer
- Pre-trained weights from ZTF real/bogus training set (public) available as starting point
- Fine-tune on confirmed NEO vs. artifact subset
- Output: calibrated real/bogus probability

**Tier 3 — Transformer on tracklet sequences** (frontier; build after Tier 2)
- Input: sequence of (RA, Dec, magnitude, time, filter) observations per tracklet, tokenized per observation
- Architecture: standard encoder-only transformer (BERT-style) with positional encoding based on observation time
- Task: multi-class classification (neo_candidate / known_object / main_belt / artifact / other)
- Training data: MPC observation history for confirmed NEOs + MBA sample + artifact labels from ZTF
- Reference: Lin et al. (2022) applied transformers to asteroid light-curve classification

**Ensemble (Tier 3 output)**
- Stacking meta-learner (logistic regression) over Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 outputs
- Calibrate final probabilities via `calibration.py` (Platt or isotonic)

### 6. orbit.py
**Inputs**: linked tracklets (≥3 nights recommended)
**Process**:
- Initial orbit determination via Gauss's method (pure Python/numpy)
- Improve with differential correction (least-squares fit to observed positions)
- Compute orbital elements: $a$, $e$, $i$, $\Omega$, $\omega$, $M_0$
- Classify as Amor/Apollo/Aten/IEO/MBA from $(a, e, q, Q)$
- Compute MOID (Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance) relative to Earth's orbit
- Assign orbit quality code (1 = arc < 1 day, 2 = multi-night, 3 = multi-week, 4 = opposition)

**Notes**:
- Use `astropy` for coordinate transformations
- For short arcs (<24 hr), MOID is unreliable — flag accordingly
- Do not use `skyfield` or `rebound` in v0; keep dependencies minimal

### 7. score.py
**Inputs**: classified tracklets with orbital elements
**Process**:
- Compute `HazardAssessment` for each candidate:
  - `moid_au` from `orbit.py`
  - `estimated_diameter_m` from absolute magnitude H using geometric albedo assumption ($p_v = 0.14$ default)
  - `hazard_flag`: PHA candidate if MOID ≤ 0.05 AU AND $H \leq 22$
  - `alert_pathway` from ordered gate (see §Alert Protocol)
- Compute derived scores:
  - `discovery_priority`: combination of novelty, orbit quality, and PHA flag
  - `followup_value`: based on brightness, arc length, orbit uncertainty
  - `scientific_interest`: unusual orbital elements, extreme $a$ or $e$, short MOID

### 8. alert.py
**Inputs**: `ScoredNEO` objects
**Process**:
- Format MPC 80-column observation report for any `alert_pathway` ≥ `mpc_submission`
- Generate human-readable candidate summary
- For `nasa_pdco_notify`: generate structured alert package (see §Alert Protocol)
- Log all alert actions with timestamps and provenance

---

## Alert Protocol

This section defines the mandatory decision tree for external reporting. **No step may be skipped.**

```
Computed MOID ≤ 0.05 AU
AND orbit quality code ≥ 2
AND Tier 1 real_bogus_score ≥ 0.90
AND NOT matched to MPC known object
         │
         ▼
Step 1: Submit to MPC via standard report format
        (astroquery.mpc or direct HTTP POST to minorplanetcenter.net)
         │
         ▼
Step 2: Monitor NEOCP for independent confirmation
        (wait ≥ 24 hours or ≥ 2 independent observatory confirmations)
         │
         ▼
Step 3: If CNEOS Scout/Sentry assigns impact probability ≥ 0.01%:
        → Open GitHub Issue tagged [HAZARD-ALERT]
        → Generate report to:
            NASA PDCO: https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/contact
            IAU CBAT:  https://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/
        → Do NOT publicly announce impact probability;
          defer all public communication to NASA/CNEOS
```

**Guardrails**:
- Never skip MPC submission and independent confirmation before Step 3
- Never quote an impact probability in any public output
- Never suppress a genuine alert out of uncertainty — report and let authorities assess
- Store full provenance (observations, orbit fit, MOID computation) with every alert

---

## ML Training Data

| Dataset | Source | Size | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| ZTF real/bogus labels | Duev et al. (2019) / Broker APIs | ~100,000 alerts | Tier 1 + Tier 2 training |
| MPC confirmed NEO catalog | `astroquery.mpc` | ~35,000 objects | Positive labels |
| MPC MBA sample | `astroquery.mpc` | large | Negative labels for NEO classifier |
| ZTF NEO observation history | IRSA | varies | Tracklet sequence training |
| ATLAS detections of known NEOs | ATLAS server | varies | Tier 1 feature validation |

**Label quality note**: Use only MPC-numbered objects as high-confidence positives. Provisional designations may be reassigned and should be treated with lower weight.

---

## Scoring Model

### Hypotheses

| Symbol | Hypothesis | Prior |
|---|---|---|
| $H_\text{neo}$ | Genuine new NEO candidate | 0.05 |
| $H_\text{ko}$ | Known MPC object | 0.30 |
| $H_\text{mba}$ | Main-belt asteroid | 0.35 |
| $H_\text{art}$ | Instrumental artifact | 0.25 |
| $H_\text{other}$ | Other solar system body | 0.05 |

Priors are deliberately pessimistic about new NEOs (most moving objects are known MBAs or artifacts). Adjust priors for high-ecliptic-latitude fields where MBA contamination is lower.

### Log-Score Model

$$\ell_i = \log P(H_i) + \sum_k w_{ik}\,\phi_k(\mathbf{D})$$

$$p_i = \frac{\exp(\ell_i - \ell_{\max})}{\sum_j \exp(\ell_j - \ell_{\max})}$$

All features $\phi_k \in [0,1]$; missing features contribute 0 (neutral).

### Key Feature Weights (planet_candidate analogue → neo_candidate)

```
log_score_neo =
    log_prior_neo
    + 2.0 * real_bogus_score
    + 1.5 * arc_coverage_score
    + 1.5 * nights_observed_score
    + 1.2 * motion_consistency_score
    + 1.0 * orbit_quality_score
    - 2.5 * known_object_score
    - 2.0 * stellar_artifact_score
    - 1.5 * main_belt_consistency_score
```

---

## Quality Commands

```bash
# Lint
ruff check .
ruff check . --fix

# Type-check
python -m mypy src

# Tests
PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest

# All three
ruff check . && python -m mypy src && PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest
```

Live integration tests (require network access to ZTF/ATLAS/MPC) must be marked:

```python
@pytest.mark.integration_live
```

and excluded from CI.

---

## Guardrails

- Never output "confirmed NEO" for internally detected objects
- Never state or imply an impact probability without MPC/CNEOS confirmation
- Always expose artifact and known-object evidence alongside every candidate score
- Store scoring model version and observation provenance with every result
- Prefer conservative classifications; when uncertain, flag for human review
- The alert protocol is non-negotiable and must be followed in full

## What Is Not Yet Built

All modules are planned. Build in the order listed in the module table.

### Immediate Next Step

Begin with `schemas.py` — define all frozen data models before writing any pipeline code. This establishes the contracts that all other modules implement against.
