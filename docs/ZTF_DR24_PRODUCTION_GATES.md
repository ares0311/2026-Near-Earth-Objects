# ZTF DR24 Production Gates

Last updated: 2026-07-02
Applies to: ZTF DR24 archival historical replay, the current primary discovery
path defined in `docs/MISSION.md` and `docs/neo_discovery_agent_brief.md`.

This gate register supersedes the WISE/DECam/TESS P1-P5 gates only for the
current primary path. The older gates remain valid historical evidence for the
secondary path, but they do not establish readiness for ZTF DR24 historical
replay.

## Production Definition

For the ZTF DR24 path, production readiness means the project can run a bounded,
time-aware historical replay over public archival ZTF data, exclude objects that
were knowable at the replay cutoff, link moving-source candidates, rank them
with auditable evidence, reject low-confidence cases, and package survivors for
operator review under fail-closed submission controls.

Production readiness does not require that a genuinely new NEO has already been
found. A confirmed discovery is an event-driven outcome after MPC/NEOCP review,
not a precondition for running the production search.

## Gates

| Gate | Status | Closure evidence required |
|---|---|---|
| Z0: Phase 0 source verification | Closed except Fink external blocker | `docs/evidence/phase0/` contains live evidence for JPL SBDB, MPC get-obs, and IRSA ZTF metadata; Fink TLS failure is documented as external; pretrained model use is deferred. |
| Z1: Bounded replay ingest | Open | A dry-run command ingests a small, documented ZTF DR24 historical window from public archive sources, writes a sample ingest report with row/file counts and hashes, and performs no live alert-stream discovery. |
| Z2: Time-aware known-object exclusion | Open | A replay cutoff is enforced. Known-object labels and exclusion queries use only catalog state available at or before the replay cutoff. Tests must fail closed when future-catalog data would leak into training or validation. |
| Z3: Source-native candidate linking | Open | A Fink-FAT-inspired linear linker forms tracklets from ZTF archival detections with measurable motion, timing, and residual diagnostics. Synthetic and known-object positive controls must produce reviewable packets. |
| Z4: Auditable ranking baseline | Open | Handcrafted tabular features plus logistic regression baseline are evaluated before LightGBM/XGBoost. Metrics include recall@K or purity@K, false-positive review burden, calibration error, and ablation against a simple baseline. |
| Z5: Retrospective validation | Open | Historical replay candidates are evaluated against later MPC/JPL outcomes after the replay window without future leakage. The report must separate recovered known objects, later-confirmed objects, artifacts, and unresolved candidates. |
| Z6: No-submission package drill | Open | At least one ZTF DR24 review packet, synthetic or recovered-known if needed, passes through adversarial review and ADES/export tooling in dry-run mode with no external submission and no impact-probability claim. |
| Z7: Operator runbook update | Open | `docs/OPERATOR_GO_NO_GO_RUNBOOK.md` includes the ZTF DR24-specific packet locations, review checklist, source attribution rule, and fail-closed MPC submission path. |

## Stop Conditions

Stop the production loop and ask for operator action only when one of these
conditions is true:

- A live command requiring the operator's Mac credentials, Keychain, or network
  access is necessary and cannot be performed from the coding-agent environment.
- A bounded replay would download or compute beyond the documented local system
  profile without explicit operator approval.
- A candidate reaches the point where external MPC submission could be
  considered.
- A public source contradicts the recorded Phase 0 behavior and needs a fresh
  live verification packet.

Do not stop merely because no candidate has been found.

## Next Coding Step

Start Z1 with a minimal bounded replay ingest design that uses verified
IRSA/JPL/MPC behavior, preserves no-future-catalog-leakage controls, and writes
compact evidence under `docs/evidence/` rather than raw operational logs.
